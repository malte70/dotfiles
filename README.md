# My dotfiles

## About

This repository contains my dotfiles, currently for the following applications:

 * abcde (A Better CD Encoder)
 * Solarized theme for Midnight Commander
 * ncmpcpp
 * Uzbl (A Browser for totally weird people)
 * vim
 * X11/Xmodmap
 * zsh

If you have ideas to extend this, just open an issue or directly make a pull
request.

## Requirements

Especially the zsh configuration largely depends on the system and the
applications installed. Currently, it is prooven to work without modifications
on the following operating systems (and might work on many others, too):

 * GNU/Linux
    * ArchLinux
    * Gentoo (on s390x a.k.a. System z)
	* Debian
 * OS X (10.6 should still be working, but only 10.10 is practically used)
 * FreeBSD and GhostBSD (which is de facto the same)
 * OpenIndiana (the Illuminos distribution, fork of OpenSolaris/SunOS)
 * Windows NT with Cygwin

### Software requirements of zsh configuration

 * Vim (soft requirement using EDITOR variable)
 * Elinks (Also a soft requirement for the BROWSER variable)
 * My shell scripts (especially gitinfo) from
   [malte70/scripts](https://github.com/malte70/scripts) in $PATH,
   so cloned to either ~/bin or ~/scripts (If ~/bin is already existing)
